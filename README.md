Machine Learning Projects

  1. Diet recommendation system:
     A diet recommendation system for patients with diverse chronic affections based on the Neural Collaborative Filtering architecture.
     - Model architecture made using Tensorflow
     - Proprietary dataset
     - Web integration for generative purposes using Gradio
     
  2. Main idea extraction
     Two fine-tuned models, Flan-T5 and Llama3-1B for main idea extraction from news articles from the CNN-Dailymail dataset.
     - Performance: Flan-T5:    Rouge1: 42.49
                    Llama3-1B:  Rouge1: 34.06
  
  4. News classification
     A news classification model using FlauBERT on given train and test datasets, as part of a university assignment.
     - Performance: 82% accuracy
